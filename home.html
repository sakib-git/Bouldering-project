        What is Bouldering?</h2>
    <p>
        Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
    
    <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">traditional climbing, </a>bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>

    <p>Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination.</p> 

<p>Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>
    accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.
